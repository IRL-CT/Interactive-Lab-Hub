===============
Python module for the[SparkFun Qwiic Joystick](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15168)

This python package is a port of the existing [SparkFun Qwiic Joystick Arduino Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Qwiic_Joystick_Arduino_Library)

This package can be used in conjunction with the overall [SparkFun qwiic Python Package](https://github.com/sparkfun/Qwiic_Py)
