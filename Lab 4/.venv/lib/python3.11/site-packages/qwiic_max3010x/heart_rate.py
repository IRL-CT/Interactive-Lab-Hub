#  Given a series of IR samples from the MAX30105 we discern when a heart beat is occurring
#
#  Let's have a brief chat about what this code does. We're going to try to detect
#  heart-rate optically. This is tricky and prone to give false readings. We really don't
#  want to get anyone hurt so use this code only as an example of how to process optical
#  data. Build fun stuff with our MAX30105 breakout board but don't use it for actual
#  medical diagnosis.

#  This is an implementation of Maxim's PBA (Penpheral Beat Amplitude) algorithm. It's been 
#  converted to work within the Arduino framework, and then to Python.
