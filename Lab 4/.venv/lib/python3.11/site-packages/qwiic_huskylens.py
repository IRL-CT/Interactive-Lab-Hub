============
Python module for the DFRobot Huskylens for use with Sparkfun Qwiic
This package can be used with the overall [SparkFun Qwiic Python Package](https://github.com/sparkfun/Qwiic_Py)

    # From the user guide: 
    # HuskyLens has two object types: Blocks and Arrows.

    # Faces, colors, objects, and tags are Block type.
    # Lines are Arrow type.

    # HuskyLens can learn to recognize Objects and assigns an ID number to each learned Object. The ID numbers are consecutive.

    # Here is a sequence that needs to be followed in order to obtain any detected object information from the HuskyLens:
    # 1. Train HuskyLens using any supported algorithm.
    # 2. Set Communications mode
    # 3. Select Algorithm desired
    # 4. Make a request for Blocks or Arrows
    # 5. Analyze returned data and take action
