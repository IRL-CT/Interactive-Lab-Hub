============
Python module for the Qwiic RFID Reader.

This python package is a port of the existing [SparkFun Qwiic RFID Arduino Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Qwiic_RFID_Arduino_Library)

This package can be used in conjunction with the overall [SparkFun qwiic Python Package](https://github.com/sparkfun/Qwiic_Py)

New to qwiic? Take a look at the entire [SparkFun qwiic ecosystem](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic).
