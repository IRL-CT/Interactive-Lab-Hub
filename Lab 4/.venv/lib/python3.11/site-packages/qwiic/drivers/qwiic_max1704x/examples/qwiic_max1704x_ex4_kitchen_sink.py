	# To quick-start or not to quick-start? That is the question!
	# Read the following and then decide if you do want to quick-start the fuel gauge.
	# "Most systems should not use quick-start because the ICs handle most startup problems transparently,
	# such as intermittent battery-terminal connection during insertion. If battery voltage stabilizes
	# faster than 17ms then do not use quick-start. The quick-start command restarts fuel-gauge calculations
	# in the same manner as initial power-up of the IC. If the system power-up sequence is so noisy that the
	# initial estimate of SOC has unacceptable error, the system microcontroller might be able to reduce the
	# error by using quick-start."
