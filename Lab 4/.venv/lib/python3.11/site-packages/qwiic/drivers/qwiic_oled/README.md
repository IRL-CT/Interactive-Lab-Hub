The SparkFun Qwiic OLED Module provides a simple and cost effective solution for adding OLED capabilities to your project. Implementing a SparkFun Qwiic I2C interface, these sensors can be rapidly added to any project with boards that are part of the SparkFun Qwiic ecosystem.

This repository implements a Python package for the SparkFun Qwiic OLED. This package works with Python, MicroPython and CircuitPython.

## About the Package

This python package enables the user to access the features of the OLED via a single Qwiic cable. This includes displaying a splashscreen, drawing shapes, writing different fonts, moving the cursor and more. The capabilities of the OLED are each demonstrated in the included examples.

## Installation 

The first step to using this package is installing it on your system. The install method depends on the python platform. The following sections outline installation on Python, MicroPython and CircuitPython.

### Python 

#### PyPi Installation

The package is primarily installed using the `pip3` command, downloading the package from the Python Index - "PyPi". 

Note - the below instructions outline installation on a Linux-based (Raspberry Pi) system.

First, setup a virtual environment from a specific directory using venv:
```sh
python3 -m venv path/to/venv
```
You can pass any path as path/to/venv, just make sure you use the same one for all future steps. For more information on venv [click here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

Next, install the qwiic package with:
```sh
path/to/venv/bin/pip3 install sparkfun-qwiic-oled
```
Now you should be able to run any example or custom python scripts that have `import qwiic_oled` by running e.g.:
```sh
path/to/venv/bin/python3 example_script.py
```

### MicroPython Installation
If not already installed, follow the [instructions here](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/mpremote.html) to install mpremote on your computer.

Connect a device with MicroPython installed to your computer and then install the package directly to your device with mpremote mip.
```sh
mpremote mip install github:sparkfun/qwiic_oled_base_py
```

If you would also like to install the examples for this repository, issue the following mip command as well:
```sh
mpremote mip install github:sparkfun/qwiic_oled_base_py@examples
```

### CircuitPython Installation
If not already installed, follow the [instructions here](https://docs.circuitpython.org/projects/circup/en/latest/#installation) to install CircUp on your computer.

Ensure that you have the latest version of the SparkFun Qwiic CircuitPython bundle. 
```sh
circup bundle-add sparkfun/Qwiic_Py
```

Then, connect a device with CircuitPython installed to your computer and then install the package directly to your device with circup.
```sh
circup install --py qwiic_oled
```

> [!NOTE]
> This library requires a decent stack size in order to run. In a file named "settings.toml" in the base directory on your CircuitPython board,
> add the following line: ```CIRCUITPY_PYSTACK_SIZE=12288```. If you don't perform this step you will likely get "pystack exhausted" errors when trying to use these modules.

If you would like to install any of the examples from this repository, issue the corresponding circup command from below. (NOTE: The below syntax assumes you are using CircUp on Windows. Linux and Mac will have different path seperators. See the [CircUp "example" command documentation](https://learn.adafruit.com/keep-your-circuitpython-libraries-on-devices-up-to-date-with-circup/example-command) for more information)

```sh
circup example qwiic_oled\ex1_splash_screen
circup example qwiic_oled\ex2_hello_world
circup example qwiic_oled\ex3_demo
circup example qwiic_oled\ex4_cube
circup example qwiic_oled\ex5_micro_bitmap
```

Example Use
 ---------------
Below is a quickstart program to print readings from the OLED.

See the examples directory for more detailed use examples and [examples/README.md](https://github.com/sparkfun/qwiic_oled_base_py/blob/main/examples/README.md) for a summary of the available examples.

```python

import qwiic_oled
import time
import sys


userOLED = qwiic_oled.QwiicMicroOled()   # Micro OLED             https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14532

def runExample():

    print("\nOLED Display - Splash screen example\n")
    myOLED = userOLED

    if not myOLED.connected:
        print("The OLED Display isn't connected to the system. Please check your connection", \
            file=sys.stderr)
        return

    myOLED.begin()

    myOLED.clear(myOLED.ALL) #  Clear the display's memory (gets rid of artifacts)
  
    myOLED.display()  #  Display buffer contents
    time.sleep(3)

    myOLED.clear(myOLED.PAGE)  #  Clear the display's buffer

    myOLED.display()
    time.sleep(3)

    qwiic_oled.oled_logos.add_logo(myOLED._screenbuffer)

    myOLED.display()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        runExample()
    except (KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit) as exErr:
        print("\nEnding OLED bitmap Example")
        sys.exit(0)

```
