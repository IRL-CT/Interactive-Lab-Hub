# Simple example for the qwiic MAX3010x device
# This demo outputs the onboard temperature sensor. 
# The temp sensor is accurate to +/-1 C but
# has an astonishing precision of 0.0625 C.

# This python library supports the SparkFun Electroncis qwiic 
# qwiic sensor/board ecosystem on a Raspberry Pi (and compatable) single
# board computers.
