# ex4_HeartBeat_Plotter.py
#
# Simple example for the qwiic MAX3010x device
# Shows the user's heart beat on a graphical plotter
# Using Matplotlib
# To learn more about plotting data in python check out this tutorial:
# https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/graph-sensor-data-with-python-and-matplotlib/
# The example code below was built using the code from the previously mentioned tutorial.
# Thanks Shawn Hymel!
#
# Instructions:
#   1) Install MatplotLib (see below)
#   2) Connect sensor to system via qwiic cable
#   3) Attach sensor to your finger with a rubber band (see below)
#   4) Run this python example
#   5) Checkout the blips!
#   6) Feel the pulse on your neck and watch it mimic the blips
#
#   It is best to attach the sensor to your finger using a rubber band or other tightening
#   device. Humans are generally bad at applying constant pressure to a thing. When you
#   press your finger against the sensor it varies enough to cause the blood in your
#   finger to flow differently which causes the sensor readings to go wonky.
#
# MatplotLib install
# Install Dependencies
# Like any good Linux project, we need to install a number of dependencies and libraries 
# in order to get matplotlib to run properly. Make sure you have an Internet connection 
# and in a terminal, enter the following commands. You may need to wait several minutes 
# while the various packages are downloaded and installed.
#
# sudo apt-get update
# sudo apt-get install libatlas3-base libffi-dev at-spi2-core python3-gi-cairo
# sudo pip3 install cairocffi
# sudo pip3 install matplotlib
