===============
Python module for the SparkFun SerLCD QWIIC products:

[SparkFun 16x2 SerLCD - RGB Backlight (Qwiic)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16396)
[SparkFun 16x2 SerLCD - RGB Text (Qwiic)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16397)
[SparkFun 20x4 SerLCD - RGB Backlight (Qwiic)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16398)

This python package enables the user to control the SerLCDs via I2C.
It is intended to be used by simply plugging in a qwiic cable for power and I2C communication.

This package can be used in conjunction with the overall [SparkFun qwiic Python Package](https://github.com/sparkfun/Qwiic_Py)
