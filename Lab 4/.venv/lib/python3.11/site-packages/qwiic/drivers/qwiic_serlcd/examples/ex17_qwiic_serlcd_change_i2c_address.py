# ex17_qwiic_serlcd_change_i2c_address.py
#
# This example demonstrates how to change the i2c address on your LCD.
# Note, once you change the address, then you will need to intatiate your class
# using your new address.
#
# Once you have changed the address, you can try using the optional instantiation
# line of code that is currently commented out.
#
# There is a set range of available addresses from 0x07 to 0x78, so make sure your 
# chosen address falls within this range. 
# 
# The next thing to note is that when you change the address you'll
# need to call an instance of the QwiicSerlcd class that includes your new
# address, like so: "myLCD = qwiic_serlcd.QwiicSerlcd(address=YOUR_NEW_ADDRESS_HERE)"
# so that the new address is fed to all the available functions. 
# 
# Finally if for some reason you've forgotten your new address. No big deal, run a 
# hardware reset on your screen to get it back to the default address (0x72).
# To cause a hardware reset, simply tie the RX pin LOW, and they cycle power 
# (while continuing to hold RX low). Then release RX, and cycle power again.
