# ex15_qwiic_serlcd_message_enable.py
#
# This example demonstrates how to turn off the system messages displayed when
# the user changes a setting. For instance 'Contrast: 5' or 'Backlight: 100%' is
# no longer displayed.
#
# Note - This example and the disableSystemMessages() and enableSystemMessages() 
# commands are only supported on SerLCD v1.2 and above.
