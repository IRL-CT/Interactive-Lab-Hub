Python module for the SparkFun Qwiic LED Stick - APA102C.

This package is a port of the existing [SparkFun Qwiic LED Stick Arduino Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Qwiic_LED_Stick_Arduino_Library).

This package can be used in conjunction with the overall [SparkFun Qwiic Python Package](https://github.com/sparkfun/Qwiic_Py).
