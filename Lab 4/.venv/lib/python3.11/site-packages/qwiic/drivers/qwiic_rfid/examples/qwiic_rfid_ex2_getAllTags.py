# Example 2
#
# This example code demonstrates how to get every RFID card off of the Qwiic RFID
# reader. The Qwiic RFID reader can hold up to 20 cards and their scan times at a
# time. If more than 20 are read then the first card is overwritten. If you
# expect this to be the case then getting the scan time will help to see when the 
# RFID card was scanned. A brief note about time. This time is not the time when the
# RFID card was scanned but the time between when the RFID card was scanned and it 
# was requested by you, the user. There are two time functions available for large 
# reads: getAllTimes() and getAllPrecTimes(), both return time in seconds but the
# second option gives you a time with two decimal point precision (0.00)
