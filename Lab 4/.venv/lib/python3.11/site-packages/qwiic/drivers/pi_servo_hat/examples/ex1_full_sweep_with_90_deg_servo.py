"""
This example should be used with a 90 degree (range of rotation) servo
on channel 0 of the Pi Servo Hat.

The extended code (commented out), at the end of the example could be
used to test the full range of the servo motion. However, users should
be wary as they can damage their servo by giving it a position outside
the standard range of motion.
