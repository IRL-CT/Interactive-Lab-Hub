The SparkFun Qwiic I2C Mux TCA9548A Module provides a simple and cost effective solution for adding I2C Mux capabilities to your project. Implementing a SparkFun Qwiic I2C interface, these sensors can be rapidly added to any project with boards that are part of the SparkFun Qwiic ecosystem.

This repository implements a Python package for the SparkFun Qwiic TCA9548A. This package works with Python, MicroPython and CircuitPython.

## About the Package

This python package enables the user to access the features of the TCA9548A via a single Qwiic cable. This includes enabling channels, disabling channels, listing channels, controlling multiple I2C devices with the same address and more. The capabilities of the TCA9548A are each demonstrated in the included examples.

## Installation 

The first step to using this package is installing it on your system. The install method depends on the python platform. The following sections outline installation on Python, MicroPython and CircuitPython.

### Python 

#### PyPi Installation

The package is primarily installed using the `pip3` command, downloading the package from the Python Index - "PyPi". 

Note - the below instructions outline installation on a Linux-based (Raspberry Pi) system.

First, setup a virtual environment from a specific directory using venv:
```sh
python3 -m venv path/to/venv
```
You can pass any path as path/to/venv, just make sure you use the same one for all future steps. For more information on venv [click here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

Next, install the qwiic package with:
```sh
path/to/venv/bin/pip3 install sparkfun-qwiic-tca9548a
```
Now you should be able to run any example or custom python scripts that have `import qwiic_tca9548a` by running e.g.:
```sh
path/to/venv/bin/python3 example_script.py
```

### MicroPython Installation
If not already installed, follow the [instructions here](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/mpremote.html) to install mpremote on your computer.

Connect a device with MicroPython installed to your computer and then install the package directly to your device with mpremote mip.
```sh
mpremote mip install github:sparkfun/qwiic_tca9548a_py
```

If you would also like to install the examples for this repository, issue the following mip command as well:
```sh
mpremote mip install github:sparkfun/qwiic_tca9548a_py@examples
```

### CircuitPython Installation
If not already installed, follow the [instructions here](https://docs.circuitpython.org/projects/circup/en/latest/#installation) to install CircUp on your computer.

Ensure that you have the latest version of the SparkFun Qwiic CircuitPython bundle. 
```sh
circup bundle-add sparkfun/Qwiic_Py
```

Finally, connect a device with CircuitPython installed to your computer and then install the package directly to your device with circup.
```sh
circup install --py qwiic_tca9548a
```

If you would like to install any of the examples from this repository, issue the corresponding circup command from below. (NOTE: The below syntax assumes you are using CircUp on Windows. Linux and Mac will have different path seperators. See the [CircUp "example" command documentation](https://learn.adafruit.com/keep-your-circuitpython-libraries-on-devices-up-to-date-with-circup/example-command) for more information)

```sh
circup example qwiic_tca9548a\qwiic_tca9548a_ex1
circup example qwiic_tca9548a\qwiic_tca9548a_ex2
circup example qwiic_tca9548a\simple_disable_channels
circup example qwiic_tca9548a\simple_enable_channels
```

Example Use
 ---------------
Below is a quickstart program to print readings from the TCA9548A.

See the examples directory for more detailed use examples and [examples/README.md](https://github.com/sparkfun/qwiic_tca9548a_py/blob/main/examples/README.md) for a summary of the available examples.

```python


import qwiic_tca9548a
import qwiic_i2c
import time
import sys

def runExample():

    print("\nSparkFun TCA9548A 8-Channel Mux Example 1\n")
    
    myTca = qwiic_tca9548a.QwiicTCA9548A()

    if myTca.connected == False:
            print("The Qwiic TCA9548A 8-Channel Mux device isn't connected to the system. Please check your connection", \
                    file=sys.stderr)
            return

    i2c = qwiic_i2c.getI2CDriver()

    while True:
        print("Enabling channels 0 and 1")
        myTca.disable_all()
        myTca.enable_channels([0,1])
        myTca.list_channels()

        print("Checking for i2c devices on ports 0 and 1")
        devices = i2c.scan()
        print("Devices found: ", devices)
        time.sleep(2)
        
        print("Enabling channels 2 and 3")
        myTca.disable_all()
        myTca.enable_channels([2,3])
        myTca.list_channels()

        print("Checking for i2c devices on ports 2 and 3")
        devices = i2c.scan()
        print("Devices found: ", devices)
        time.sleep(2)

if __name__ == '__main__':
	try:
		runExample()
	except (KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit) as exErr:
		print("\nEnding Example 1")
		sys.exit(0)
