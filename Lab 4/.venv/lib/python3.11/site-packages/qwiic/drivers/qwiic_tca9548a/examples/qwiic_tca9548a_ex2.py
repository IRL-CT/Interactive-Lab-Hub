# Description: 
#   This example shows how to hook up two VL53L1X laser distance sensors with the same address.
#   You can read the VL53L1X hookup guide and get the library from https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/qwiic-distance-sensor-vl53l1x-hookup-guide
#==================================================================================
# Hardware Connections: 
#   Attach the Qwiic Mux Board to your control board with a Qwiic cable to the "Main" port on the Mux Board
#   Plug a VL53L1X device into port 0 and another into port 1
