# Description: 
#   Some I2C devices respond to only one I2C address. This can be a problem
#   when you want to hook multiple of a device to the I2C bus. An I2C Mux
#   solves this issue by allowing you to change the 'channel' or port that
#   the master is talking to.

#   This example shows how to connect to different ports.
#   First, any devices connected to port 0 and 1 will have their i2c addresses printed, then any devices connected to ports 2 and 3
#   Make sure you do not have multiple devices with the same i2c address connected to BOTH ports 0 and 1, or 2 and 3
#==================================================================================
# Hardware Connections: 
#   Attach the Qwiic Mux Board to your control board with a Qwiic cable to the "Main" port on the Mux Board
#   Plug device(s) into ports 0, 1, 2 and/or 3
