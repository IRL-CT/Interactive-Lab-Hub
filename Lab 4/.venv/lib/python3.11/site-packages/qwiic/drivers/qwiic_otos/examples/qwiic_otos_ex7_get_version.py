#
# This example demonstrates how to get the hardware and firmware version
# numbers from the SparkFun Qwiic Optical Tracking Odometry Sensor (OTOS).

# There may be future hardware and/or firmware changes of the OTOS, so you can
# use this example to check which version you have. See the product page or
# hardware repository to see what the latest version is:
