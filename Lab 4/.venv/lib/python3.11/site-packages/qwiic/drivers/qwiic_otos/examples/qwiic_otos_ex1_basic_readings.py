#
# This example demonstrates how to read the position and heading from the
# SparkFun Qwiic Optical Tracking Odometry Sensor (OTOS).
#
# This example should be used to verify that the OTOS is connected and
# functioning correctly. It will just print the position and heading tracked
# by the OTOS to the serial monitor. It is recommended that you check out the
# other examples before using the OTOS in your own project.
