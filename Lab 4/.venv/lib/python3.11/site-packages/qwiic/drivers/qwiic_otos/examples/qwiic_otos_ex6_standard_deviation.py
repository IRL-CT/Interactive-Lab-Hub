# qwiic_otos_ex6_standard_deviation.py
#
# This example demonstrates how to read the standard deviation of the
# measurements of the SparkFun Qwiic Optical Tracking Odometry Sensor (OTOS).

# The OTOS uses Kalman filters to estimate the position, velocity, and
# acceleration of the x, y, and heading. The square root of the diagonal
# elements of the covariance matrices are provided for the standard deviation
# of each measurement. THEY DO NOT REPRESENT THE ACTUAL TRACKING ERROR! These
# are statistical quantities that assume a correct model of the system, but
# there could be unmodelled error sources that cause the physical error to
# become larger than these statistical error (eg. improper calibration, or
# tilting the OTOS to not be flat against the tracking surface). These are
# provided primarily for anyone wanting to perform sensor fusion with
# additional sensors.
