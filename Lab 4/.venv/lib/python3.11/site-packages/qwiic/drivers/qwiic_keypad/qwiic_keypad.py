============
Python module for the[SparkFun Qwiic Keypad - 12 Button Breakout](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15290)

This python package is a port of the existing [SparkFun Qwiic Keypad Arduino Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Qwiic_Keypad_Arduino_Library)

This package can be used in conjunction with the overall [SparkFun qwiic Python Package](https://github.com/sparkfun/Qwiic_Py)

New to qwiic? Take a look at the entire [SparkFun qwiic ecosystem](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic).
