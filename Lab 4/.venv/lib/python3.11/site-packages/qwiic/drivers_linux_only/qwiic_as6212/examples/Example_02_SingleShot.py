#
# Simple Example for the Qwiic AS6212 Device
#
# This example uses the Single Shot Feature of the device.
# It puts the sensor into sleep mode, and then in order to take
# each reading, it calls the trigger_single_shot_conversion() function.
# This allows us to take single readings on demand and really
# keep power use to a minimum.
#
# Note, in the basic readings example, we are "waking up" the sensor
# (by turning sleep mode off), and then it enters continuous reading mode,
# and so the sensor will continue to make conversions at the set conversion cycle time (4Hz).
# This uses more power, but can be useful if you want to setup an alert, and can
# be even finer tuned by setting up the amount of desired consecutive faults.
#
# Note, using single shot readings like in this example, can also
# allow you to poll the SS bit (and know when the conversion is complete)
# SS bit = 0 = No conversion ongoing / conversion finished
# SS bit = 1 = Start single shot conversion / conversion ongoing
# This can allow you to immediate start another conversion, and increase
# the amount of conversions you demand.
#
# As the device exhibits a very short conversion time (~36ms-51ms), the effective conversion
# rate can be increased by setting the single shot bit repetitively after a conversion has finished.
# However, it has to be ensured that the additional power is limited, otherwise self-heating
# effects have to be considered.
