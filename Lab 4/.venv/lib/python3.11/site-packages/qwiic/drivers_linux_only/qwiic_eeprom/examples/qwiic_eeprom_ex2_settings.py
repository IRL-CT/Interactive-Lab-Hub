# This example demonstrates how to set the various settings for a given EEPROM.
# Read the datasheet! Each EEPROM will have specific values for: 
# Overall EEPROM size in bytes (512kbit = 64000, 256kbit = 32000)
# Bytes per page write (64 and 128 are common)
# Whether write polling is supported
