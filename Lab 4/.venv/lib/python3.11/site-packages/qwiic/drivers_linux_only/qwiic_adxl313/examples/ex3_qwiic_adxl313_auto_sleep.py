#
# Simple Example for the Qwiic ADXL313 DeviceSet that shows how to use Autosleep feature.
# First, setup THRESH_INACT, TIME_INACT, and participating axis.
# These settings will determine when the unit will go into autosleep mode and save power!
# We are only going to use the x-axis (and are disabling y-axis and z-axis).
# This is so you can place the board "flat" inside your project,
# and we can ignore gravity on z-axis.
