# ex7_qwiic_adxl313_fifo.py
#
# Simple Example for the Qwiic ADXL313 DeviceSet that shows how to setup the FIFO on the ADXL313.
# One key advantage of using the FIFO is that it allows us to
# let the ADXL313 store up to 32 samples in it's FIFO "buffer".
# While it is doing this, we can use our microcontroller to do other things,
# Then, when the FIFO is full (or close to), we can quickly read in the 32 samples.

# In order to use the FIFO in this way, we need to set it up to fire an interrupt
# when it gets "almost full". This threshold of samples is called the "watermark".
# When the watermark level is reached, it will fire the interrupt INT1.
# Our raspi will be monitoring the watermark int source bit, and then quickly
# read whatevers in the FIFO and save it to a log file.
# Note, we can't print the data in real time to the terminal
# because python terminal is too slow.

# Some timestamps of each stage of this cycle will also be printed.
# This will allow us to fine tune bandwidth and watermark settings.
# The "Entries" of the FIFO_STATUS register will also be printed before each read.
# This will tell us how many samples are currently held in the FIFO.
# This will allow us to read the entire contents and keep an eye on how full it is
# getting before each read. This will help us fine tune how much time we have
# between each read to do other things. (in this example, we are simplly going to do
# a delay and print dots, but you could choose to do more useful things).

# **SPI app note***
# Note, this example uses I2C to communicate the the sensor.
# If you are going to use SPI, then you will need to add in a sufficient
# delay in between reads (at least 5uSec), to allow the FIFO to "pop" the next
# reading in the data registers. See datasheet page 16 for more info.

# ///// FIFO setup //////
# Stream mode
# Trigger INT1, Note, this example does not utilize monitoring this hardware interrupt.
# We will be monitoring via software by reading the int source and watching the 
# watermark bit.
# Watermark Threshold (aka (samples in FIFO_CTL register)): 30

# ///// Interrupt setup //////
# Enable watermark interrupt.
# Map watermark interrupt to "int pin 1".
# This harware interrupt pin setup could be monitored by a GPIO on the raspi,
# or external system, however, for this example, we will simply
# poll the interrupt register via software to monitor its status.
