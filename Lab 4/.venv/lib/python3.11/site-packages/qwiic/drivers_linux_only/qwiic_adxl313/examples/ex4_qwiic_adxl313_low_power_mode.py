# ex4_qwiic_adxl313_low_power_mode.py
#
#   Shows how to use Low Power feature. 
#   In addition to turning on low power mode, you will also want to consider
#   bandwidth rate. This will affect your results in low power land.
#   In this example, we will turn on low power mode and set BW to 12.5Hz.
#   Then we will only take samples at or above 12.5Hz (so we don't miss samples)
