#
# Simple Example for the Qwiic ADXL313 DeviceSet that Shows how to switch the sensor 
# between stanby mode and measure mode.
# This example will put the device in measure mode and print 100 readings to terminal,
# Then enter standby mode for 5 seconds.
# Then loop.
# Note, the typical current required in each mode is as follows:
# Standby: 0.1uA
# Measure: 55-170uA
